### **Data Cleaning**

In the initial data preparation phase, we pperformed the following tasks:
1. Data Loading and Inspection
2. Data Cleaning and Formatting using the Power Query Editor

### **Exploratory Data Analysis**
EDA involved exploring the Office Supply dataset to answer the following questions:

1. Calculate
  - Gross Sales
  - Discount (use the discount rate)
  - Revenue
  - Profit before Tax
  - Profit Margin
  - Tax on Profit (tax rate 5%)
  - Profit after Tax
2. Create a report overview for:
  - Segment
  - State
  - Product
3. Produce a report on all products sold between January and December 2014, showing number of sales, sales proportions and financial performance. This analysis should determine if there is growth or decline on any of the product lines.
4. Compare 2013 Q4 and 2014 Q4 figures to highlight year on year results. Reproduce the report at higher levels such as Product category and State.
5. What key products are the drivers of performance?
6. If we would like to discontinue any product sub due to poor outcomes, what would this be?
7. What product do we pay the highest tax on?
  -  Overall
  - For each state
  - For each segment

### **Data Analysis**
```Gross Sales = financials3[Units Sold]*financials3[Sale Price]```

```Discount = financials3[Discount Rate]*financials3[Gross Sales]```

```Revenue = financials3[Gross Sales]-financials3[Discount]```

```Profit Before Tax = financials3[Revenue]-financials3[Manufacture Cost]```

```Profit Margin = [Total Profit]/[Total Revenue]```

```Tax on Profit = 0.05*financials3[Profit Before Tax]```

```Profit after Tax = financials3[Profit Before Tax]-financials3[Tax]```

```Sales Proportion = financials3[Manufacture Cost]/financials3[Units Sold]*100```

### **Results**

This visuals shows that Midmarket and Channel Partners made huge losses while small Business made the highest amount of profit in the Segment overview.
Based on State overview, high manufacturing cost in producing products, high revenue was generated but no significant profit gotten.
The production of Staplers and Notepads should be suspended because of the losses made, thereby generating little or no profit in th Product Overview.

### **Prescriptive Analytics**

 - Based on our Descriptive and Diagnostic Analysis of this business, we recommend that A B C Stationary company should continue in the production of Biro, A4 Paper and Pencil because it will make and not mar the company by maximizing profit.
  - An Audit on all their financial records with regards to the products and segments in view should take place due to the fact that there is a rampant occurrence of the manufacturing cost either higher or the same with the revenue gotten.
 - We also recommend that there should be a slight increase in the selling price of products because it looks like the economy is affecting their output negatively.
 - An audit on all sections in the company for the inspection of any fraudulent activity should be carried out in the respective departments.
 - A market research or survey should be conducted by A B C Stationary to get feedback from their end users on how to improve their products.
 - The production of Staplers, Markers and Notepads should be suspended indefinitely because it is producing no significant revenue even with high manufacturing cost.

   By following these steps, A B C Stationary will be able to have reasonable profits in years to come.
